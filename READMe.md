 <My first mini project>

Topic: Photograpghy 
    
     I have used html , css , bootstrap in this mini project

     Features:

     1. used bootstrap to make nav-bar and i also make it sticky so that my nav will be at the top of the screen always.
     2. some images are clicked by me so i uploaded them in imgbb which generated image link which i have used in the project.
     3. i used some images from upslash.com so that whenever my page is opened the images will change.
     4. for caption i used lorem ipsum for  upslash images.
     5. also my nav bar is working if you click on contack it will directly take to my contact details, if you click on home it will be at the top.
